# This file lists the Python dependencies needed to run the AI Visibility
# generator for multi‑sheet Excel workbooks.  It is read by the GitHub
# Actions workflow before running the generator script.  Each line
# specifies a package and an optional version range.  If you modify
# `generate_files_xlsx.py` to add additional functionality, add the
# corresponding dependencies here.

# Pandas is used to read and manipulate dataframes from the Excel
# workbook.

# pandas will raise a “Missing optional dependency ‘openpyxl’” error.
